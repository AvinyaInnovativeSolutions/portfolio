        <p class="Introduction">Hello! I am Aadarsh A.K. A school-going student who is interested in programming, 
        this is my portfolio website where you can view all the projects that I have done so far. I first started 
        learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own simple web pages. Then, I slowly moved onto Python to create 
        command line interface applications. Here you can see the philosophy and the work put behind all my projects.

        <p class="project_info">CHEMeaseTry is an application built using python which can display
           certain details of an element upon the entry of its atomic number.<br>
           The first step was to create a class of an atom and define its properties 
           and functions.<br>
           The first function would return the electronic configuration of the element 
           in the form of a list.<br>
           Using the data obtained from the previous function, we can now draw the schematic
           diagram of the element using the turtle library in python.<br>
           I have also sourced a csv file from www.kaggle.com which contains certain details
           which are unique to certain elements and cannot be obtained by mere mathematical
           calculations.<br>
           From the csv file wfe can obtain the element name, atomic mass etc. The element name
           will be displayed on the title bar of the turtle window.
