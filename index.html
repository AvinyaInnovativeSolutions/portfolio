    <h1 class="greeting">Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
    <p class="Introduction">Hello! I am Aadarsh A.K. A school-going student who is interested in programming, 
       this is my portfolio website where you can view all the projects that I have done so far. I first started 
       learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own simple web pages. Then, I slowly moved onto Python to create 
       command line interface applications. Here you can see the philosophy and the work put behind all my projects.
